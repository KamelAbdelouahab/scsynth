function VerilogReSCGenerator(coeff, N, m_input, m_coeff, nameSuffix)
  %Reconfigurable Architecture Based on Stochastic Logic, or ReSC, is a methods
  %developed by Weikang Qian, Xin Li, Marc D. Riedel, Kia Bazargan, and David J.
  %Lilja for approximating the computation of any function with domain and range
  %in the unit interval as a stochastic circuit using a Bernstein polynomial
  %approximation of the function. This function generates a complete ReSC module
  %written in Verilog, containing the following files:
  % ReSC_[nameSuffix].v - The core stochastic module
  % ReSC_wrapper_[nameSuffix].v - A wrapper for the module that converts inputs
  %                               inputs and outputs between binary and
  %                               stochastic representations.
  % ReSC_test_[nameSuffix].v - A testbench for the system.
  % LFSR_[log(N)]_bit_added_zero_[nameSuffix].v - The RNG for generating
  %                                               stochastic numbers.
  
  %Parameters:
  % coeff     : a list of coefficients of the Bernstein polynomial; each
  %             coefficient should fall within the unit interval
  % N         : the length of the stochastic bitstreams, must be a power of 2
  % m_input   : the length in bits of the input, at most log2(N)
  % m_coeff   : the length in bits of the coefficients, at most log2(N)
  % nameSuffix: a distinguishing suffix to append to the name of each Verilog
  %             module
