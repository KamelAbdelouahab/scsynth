  %Reconfigurable Architecture Based on Stochastic Logic, or ReSC, is a method
  %developed by Weikang Qian, Xin Li, Marc D. Riedel, Kia Bazargan, and David J.
  %Lilja for approximating the computation of any function with domain and range
  %in the unit interval as a stochastic circuit using a Bernstein polynomial
  %approximation of the function. This function, given a function handle, 
  %generates a complete ReSC module written in Verilog, containing the following
  %files:
  % ReSC_[nameSuffix].v - The core stochastic module
  % ReSC_wrapper_[nameSuffix].v - A wrapper for the module that converts inputs
  %                               inputs and outputs between binary and
  %                               stochastic representations.
  % ReSC_test_[nameSuffix].v - A testbench for the system.
  % LFSR_[log(N)]_bit_added_zero_[nameSuffix].v - The RNG for generating
  %                                               stochastic numbers.
  
  %Parameters:
  % func      : a function handle for the function being modeled
  % degree    : the desired degree of the Bernstein polynomial underlying the
  %             ReSC (higher means a larger circuit but less error)
  % N         : the length of the stochastic bitstreams, must be a power of 2
  % m_input   : the length in bits of the input, at most log2(N)
  % m_coeff   : the length in bits of the coefficients, at most log2(N)
  % nameSuffix: a distinguishing suffix to append to the name of each Verilog
  %             module
  
  %Optional Parameters:
  % singleWeightLFSR: Use the same LFSR for every constant. (Default true)
  % domain          : the domain over which to model  (Default [0, 1])
  % granularity     : the number of data points to sample in approximating the
  %                   the function
  addpath(genpath('.'));
  
  x = [domain(1):(domain(2) - domain(1))/granularity:domain(2)];
  y = arrayfun(func, x);
